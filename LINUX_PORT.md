# Linux Port

**Status (2026-09-22): ported.** Oxide builds, links, passes its test suite
and runs on Linux (Wayland, Vulkan). The `linux-port` branch carries the
work; this file is now the record of what was done, what was verified on
real hardware, and what is still open. The original plan's phases are kept
as headings so the decisions stay traceable.

Target machine: an Arch-based **Omarchy 4** desktop — Hyprland (Wayland),
tiling-first, Super-key-driven. Verified there on 2026-09-22 with the
graphical session (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1`, AMD Radeon 780M / RADV).
Nothing in the port is Arch- or Hyprland-specific; the packaging covers any
distro through the tarball and Arch through the AUR.

## What changed

Platform differences are confined to `cfg` sites in a handful of files.
Nothing else in the crate knows which OS it's on.

| area | macOS | Linux | where |
|---|---|---|---|
| bell | `NSBeep` | `canberra-gtk-play` (XDG theme), falling back to `paplay`,then the visual flash | `terminal/mod.rs` `system_beep` |
| foreground cwd | `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDVNODEPATHINFO)` | `/proc/<pgrp>/cwd` | `terminal/session.rs` |
| foreground name / argv | `proc_pidinfo` + `KERN_PROCARGS2` | `/proc/<pid>/comm` (+ `exe` for the untruncated name), `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` | `terminal/process.rs` |
| notifications | `UNUserNotificationCenter` (bundle) / `osascript` | `notify-send -A default=Open -w`; a click prints the action and routes back to the pane | `notifications.rs`, `Cargo.toml` (`objc`/`block` are macOS-only deps) |
| updater | download DMG, swap bundle, relaunch | announce only: pill opens the release page once the update manifest has a `linux-<arch>` entry | `update.rs`, `app.rs` `UpdateState::Available` |
| "installed?" gate | running from a `.app` | release build outside a `target/` dir | `update::is_installed` |
| trash | `~/.Trash` | XDG trash, via the `trash` crate on both | `tree/mod.rs` `delete_entry` |
| reveal | `open -R` | `App::reveal_path` (Finder / `org.freedesktop.FileManager1`) on both | `tree/mod.rs`, `keymap/actions.rs` title |
| no-`$EDITOR` fallback | `open -t` | `xdg-open` | `app.rs` `editor_snippet` |
| window | hidden titlebar + 30px inset, traffic lights | `app_id = "oxide"`, no inset, compositor decorations | `app.rs` `open_oxide_window`, `Oxide::render` |
| lifecycle | stays running with no windows, Dock reopens | last window closed → quit; no menu bar | `main.rs` |
| open-modifier | cmd-click / cmd-hover | ctrl-click / ctrl-hover | `terminal::open_modifier`, five call sites |
| keymap | `MACOS` table (`cmd-*`) | `LINUX` table (`ctrl-shift-*`, `alt-<n>`); `SHARED` for the rest | `keymap/default.rs` |
| key labels | `⇧⌘P` | `Ctrl+Shift+P` | `keymap/resolve.rs` `pretty_keys` |
| primary selection | — | selection → primary, middle-click pastes it | `terminal/mod.rs` |
| shift-at-launch | `window.modifiers()` at `new` | first `ModifiersChanged` within 1.5s of the window opening | `app.rs` `on_launch_modifiers`, `TerminalPane::cancel_startup` |

Packaging and CI:

- `scripts/linux-package.sh` → `target/oxide-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`
  (binary, `.desktop`, hicolor icons, licence, `install.sh`).
- `scripts/linux-install.sh` (shipped as `install.sh`): `~/.local` by
  default, `--prefix`, `--uninstall`.
- `scripts/release-linux.sh`: build, `gh release upload`, bump the AUR
  PKGBUILD. The release is two-machine — see `RELEASING.md` §4.
- `packaging/aur/oxide-terminal-bin/PKGBUILD`: from the release tarball.
  `depends` reflects `ldd` on the built binary (xcb/xkbcommon), plus the
  runtime-loaded `wayland`, `vulkan-icd-loader`, and `libnotify`.
- `assets/linux/`: `oxide.desktop` (`StartupWMClass=oxide` matches the
  `app_id`) and pre-rendered hicolor icons, so packaging needs no image tool.
- `scripts/oxide-cli` branches on `uname`; on Linux it finds the real
  binary on PATH and detaches. Not needed for normal installs — the binary
  itself is `oxide` and takes the same arguments.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: the Linux job is now `cargo build
  --all-targets` + `cargo test`, required (no `continue-on-error`), with
  `fish zsh dash libnotify-bin` installed for the cross-shell tests.

## Verified on the Omarchy box (2026-09-22)

Done with the debug build, a scratch directory, `grim` screenshots and
`wtype` for keys (Omarchy's `hyprctl dispatch` is a Lua wrapper —
`sendshortcut`/`focuswindow` in the classic syntax silently error, and
focus follows the mouse, so keystroke injection is only reliable while the
pointer is over the Oxide window).

- [x] `cargo build --all-targets` links; `cargo test`: 173 passed
- [x] `cargo run` opens a window under Hyprland; `hyprctl clients` shows
      `class: oxide`, `xwayland: false`, tiled with no top inset
- [x] shell spawns, prompt renders with the bundled Nerd Font, powerline
      glyphs correct
- [x] tree follows `cd` (procfs `cwd`); status bar and title update
- [x] tab title shows the foreground command (`sleep` via procfs `comm`)
- [x] `ctrl-shift-t` new tab, `alt-1` tab select
- [x] `ctrl-w v` split, `ctrl-w <` narrows — shifted punctuation arrives as
      the composed character, as predicted
- [x] Linux keymap tables pass the parse/registry/coverage tests; palette
      labels are `Ctrl+Shift+…` (unit-tested)
- [x] `notify-send -A default=Open -w` is accepted by the running daemon
      (Omarchy's quickshell) and waits on the notification
- [x] `window.opacity = 0.85` + `blur = true`: the wallpaper shows through
      and looks blurred (KDE blur protocol, Hyprland)
- [x] SIGTERM/quit leaves no orphaned shells
- [x] trash: `trash::delete` unit path; `~/.local/share/Trash` is what the
      crate targets

Still to eyeball by hand (input injection was stopped once the pointer moved
to another window):

- [ ] tree `d` → `y` lands the file in `~/.local/share/Trash/files/`
- [ ] "Reveal in File Manager" opens the file manager on the containing
      folder (GPUI's `org.freedesktop.FileManager1` call)
- [ ] a long command finishing unfocused → notification; clicking it
      focuses the pane
- [ ] ctrl-click opens a URL / path, ctrl-hover underlines; Super+click
      still moves the window
- [ ] middle-click pastes the primary selection
- [ ] shift held while launching skips startup commands (needs a pinned
      workspace with a startup command)
- [ ] closing the last window (`ctrl-shift-w` on the last pane) exits the
      process
- [ ] **X11**: `WAYLAND_DISPLAY= oxide` on this box starts, spawns the
      shell and runs its event loop, but no XWayland window ever appears
      (no `_NET_CLIENT_LIST` entry, nothing on stderr). Not chased further —
      Wayland is the target here. Worth a look on a real Xorg session
      before advertising X11.
- [ ] resize storms with `htop` running (SIGWINCH debounce)
- [ ] config live-reload (inotify)

## Decisions (as built)

1. **Linux keymap**: `ctrl-shift-*` for the `cmd-*` set, `alt-1..9` tabs,
   `ctrl-alt-1..9` workspaces, `ctrl-pageup/pagedown` tab cycling,
   `ctrl-shift-o` file finder, `ctrl-w shift-t` theme picker. Font size is
   `ctrl-+`/`ctrl-=`/`ctrl--`/`ctrl-0` (GPUI's xkb path reports a shifted
   symbol as the symbol with shift dropped, so `ctrl-shift-=` *is*
   `ctrl-+`). No `ctrl-_` — readline's undo. Super is never bound. hide /
   hide-others / minimise / fullscreen are the compositor's.
2. **Last-window-close on Linux**: quit.
3. **Trash**: the `trash` crate, both platforms.
4. **Updater on Linux**: announce-only pill → release page; requires the
   manifest's Linux entry so the pill never points at a mac-only release.
5. **`window.titlebar`**: ignored on Linux; GPUI requests server-side
   decorations (Hyprland: none; KDE/sway: a title bar; GNOME: none, no SSD).
6. **Shift-at-launch**: key-event fallback, 1.5s window. `--no-startup-
   commands` stays the universal out.
7. **Notifications**: `notify-send` with `-A`/`-w` for click routing, plain
   retry if the flags are rejected (libnotify < 0.7.9).
8. **Blur**: left on; works under Hyprland.
9. **cmd-click**: ctrl-click.
10. **Release artifact**: built on the Linux box, uploaded after the mac
    release; PKGBUILD bumped by `release-linux.sh`.
11. **Window bounds** (deviation from the plan): still saved and restored on
    Linux. Harmless under a tiling WM (the compositor overrides) and useful
    under a floating one.
12. **Binary name**: the Linux binary is `oxide`; there is no wrapper in
    the tarball or the package. `scripts/oxide-cli` is optional, for the
    macOS-style detached launch.

## Open items / follow-ups

- ~~**`-e <command>` flag** so Oxide can be an `xdg-terminal-exec` target
  (Omarchy's Super+Return).~~ Done: `-e` and `--app-id` in `cli.rs`, the
  first pane runs the command with no shell integration, and
  `assets/linux/oxide.desktop` declares `X-TerminalArgExec` /
  `X-TerminalArgAppId`. Pinned workspaces are not restored for a `-e` launch.
- **X11** (above).
- ~~**`bell = "sound"`** on Linux: XDG sound theme / PipeWire, if anyone
  asks.~~ Done: `canberra-gtk-play` plays the XDG theme's bell sound,
  falling back to `paplay` on the stock freedesktop sound if libcanberra's
  CLI isn't installed. Runs on a background thread.
- **Self-update on Linux**: AppImage would allow it; not planned.
- **Flatpak**: still not worth it (sandboxed terminals fight the host shell).
- **Generated config template** (`config/mod.rs`): key names in comments are
  localised at write time; keep the token table there in step with the
  Linux keymap when bindings change.
- `Cargo.lock` grew Windows-only entries from the `trash` crate; harmless.
