# The Linux half of a release. release.sh runs on the Mac (DMGs, manifest,
# cask, site changelog) and GPUI can't be cross-compiled, so the tarball is
# built here, published to downloads.omnipty.com (R2) beside the DMGs,
# mirrored onto the same GitHub release, and added to the update manifest:
#
#   scripts/release-linux.sh            build, sign, upload, bump the AUR PKGBUILD
#   NO_UPLOAD=1 scripts/release-linux.sh   just build and bump
#
# Run it from the release commit (the one tagged v<version>), after
# release.sh has finished. Then push the AUR package:
#
#   cd packaging/aur/omnipty-bin
#   makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
#   git -C <aur clone> ... (see RELEASING.md)
#
# One-time setup is in RELEASING.md ("One-time setup on the Linux box").
