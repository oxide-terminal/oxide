# The binary is built inside the packaging/docker container, not on the host.
# A binary links against the glibc symbol versions of whatever built it and
# refuses to start anywhere older; issue #2 was an Arch-built (glibc 2.44)
# tarball that Ubuntu 24.04 (2.39) couldn't load. The container is Ubuntu
# 22.04, glibc 2.35, and the check after the build refuses to package a
# binary needing more — so NO_DOCKER=1 only yields a shippable tarball on a
# host at least that old. Run the script as yourself, not under sudo: the
# build runs as your uid so the output stays yours.
